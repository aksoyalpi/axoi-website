# About

## Who I Am

Hi! I'm a passionate developer focused on creating minimalistic, useful, and user-friendly mobile applications — especially tailored to the needs of the Muslim community. I believe in building software that is simple, respectful of privacy, and truly beneficial to its users.

I develop apps that are:

- **Free and ad-free** 🙌  
- **Respectful of privacy** 🔒  
- **Lightweight and fast** ⚡  
- **Multi-language** 🌍  
- **Dark/Light mode ready** 🌗
